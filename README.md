# Project Overview

This interactive dashboard provides in-depth analysis of global weather patterns, environmental factors, and geographical variations using the World Weather Dataset. It allows users to explore how climate conditions change across regions and how weather impacts air quality, tourism, and broader environmental trends.

# Key Features

Here are the key features of the dashboard:

* Climate Analysis – Study long-term climate trends and seasonal variations in different regions.
* Environmental Impact – Analyze air quality metrics and their correlation with weather parameters.
* Tourism Planning – Identify optimal travel periods based on historical weather conditions.
* Geographical Patterns – Compare weather trends across different continents and countries.

# Data Sources

For this analysis, I used the World Weather Repository, a continuously updated dataset available ![here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/nelgiriyewithana/global-weather-repository/data). 

# Tools Used

* SQL
* Tableau

# Key Questions

Here are the key questions we aim to answer through this interactive dashboard:

* How have long-term climate trends and seasonal variations evolved across different regions?
* What is the relationship between air quality metrics and various weather parameters?
* When are the optimal travel periods based on historical weather conditions?
* How do weather patterns vary across different continents, countries and over time?
* And more
